Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a protocol that allows large language models (LLMs) and various computational services (called “servers” in MCP) to interact in a common environment, enabling the creation of powerful AI-driven agents. In simpler terms, MCP helps orchestrate how different tools, data sources, and models communicate. By abstracting away many low-level details and providing a straightforward server-based integration approach, MCP makes it easier for developers to build robust, multi-step AI applications—including sophisticated agents that can perform tasks such as SQL query generation, execution, and result summarization.

In this guide, we explore how to build a Text2SQL Agent using the mcp-agent repository. Our agent will take a natural language query as input, write SQL on the fly, execute it against a Postgres database, and return the results. The underlying technologies (OpenAI, Anthropic, or others) can be flexibly swapped in and out thanks to MCP’s server-based architecture.
