## Product Requirements Document: Simple Video Library

---

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Simple Video Library desktop application. The application will allow users to manage and interact with a predefined list of videos. Users will be able to view video details, create playlists, simulate playing videos (incrementing play counts), and update video ratings. The application will feature a graphical user interface.

---

### 2. Goals

* To provide a simple interface for users to browse a collection of videos.
* To allow users to check details of specific videos, including name, director, rating, and play count.
* To enable users to create a custom playlist of videos from the library.
* To simulate playing videos from a playlist by incrementing their play counts.
* To allow users to update the rating of videos in the library.

---

### 3. Target Users

* General users who want a simple way to manage and track a small personal video collection.

### 4. Product Features

#### 4.1 Main Application Window

* **Overview**: This is the entry point of the application.
* **Functionality**:
    * Display a clear instruction or welcome message to the user.
    * Provide distinct options (e.g., buttons) for users to navigate to different modules:
        * An option to "Check Videos."
        * An option to "Create Video List."
        * An option to "Update Videos."
    * Display a status area for general application feedback.

#### 4.2 Video Checking Module

* **Overview**: Allows users to view all available videos and check details of a specific video.
* **Functionality**:
    * **List All Videos**:
        * Users can trigger an action (e.g., click a button) to display a list of all videos available in the library.
        * The list should present key information for each video, such as its identifier, name, director, rating representation (e.g., stars), and play count.
        * This list should be displayed in a scrollable area if the number of videos exceeds the viewable space.
    * **Check Specific Video**:
        * Users can input a video identifier (e.g., number).
        * Upon confirming the input (e.g., clicking a button), the system will retrieve and display detailed information for the specified video.
        * Displayed details should include the video's name, director, rating, and play count.
        * If the entered video identifier is not found, an appropriate error message must be shown.
    * A status area should provide feedback on user actions.

#### 4.3 Playlist Creation Module

* **Overview**: Allows users to curate a playlist from the available videos, simulate playback, and clear the playlist.
* **Functionality**:
    * **Add to Playlist**:
        * Users can input a video identifier.
        * Upon confirming the input (e.g., clicking a button), if the video identifier is valid, the video's name (or other suitable representation) is added to a temporary playlist.
        * A display area should clearly show all videos currently in the playlist.
        * If the video identifier is invalid, an appropriate error message must be shown.
    * **Simulate Playlist Playback**:
        * Users can trigger an action (e.g., click a button) to "play" the current playlist.
        * This action will increment the play count for each video in the playlist within the central video library.
        * A confirmation message should indicate that the playlist has been "played" and play counts updated.
    * **Reset Playlist**:
        * Users can trigger an action (e.g., click a button) to clear the current playlist.
        * The display area for the playlist should be emptied.
        * A confirmation message should indicate the playlist has been reset.
    * A status area should provide feedback on user actions.

#### 4.4 Video Update Module

* **Overview**: Allows users to modify the rating of a specific video.
* **Functionality**:
    * **Update Rating**:
        * Users can input a video identifier.
        * Users can input a new rating value for the video.
        * Upon confirming the inputs (e.g., clicking a button):
            * If the video identifier is valid, the video's rating in the central library is updated.
            * A confirmation message should be displayed, showing the video's name, its new rating, and its current play count.
            * If the video identifier is invalid, an appropriate error message must be shown.
    * A status area should provide feedback on user actions.

#### 4.5 Video Library Backend

* **Data Storage**:
    * The system will maintain a collection of video items.
    * Each video item will store attributes such as name, director, rating, and play count.
* **Core Operations**: The backend must support:
    * Retrieving a list of all videos with their essential details.
    * Fetching detailed information (name, director, rating, play count) for a specific video based on its identifier.
    * Updating the rating of a specific video.
    * Retrieving the play count of a specific video.
    * Incrementing the play count of a specific video.
* **Initial Data**: The library will be pre-populated with a default set of videos.

#### 4.6 Font and Styling

* The application should use clear, legible fonts.
* Font sizes should be appropriate for comfortable reading on a desktop application.
* Consistent styling should be applied across different modules of the application.

### 5. User Interface (General Considerations)

* The application will provide a graphical user interface.
* Navigation between different modules should be intuitive.
* Standard UI elements (buttons, input fields, display areas) will be used.
* User feedback (e.g., success messages, error messages, status updates) should be clearly communicated.

---

### 6. Error Handling (General)

* **Invalid Input**: The system must handle invalid user inputs gracefully. For instance, if a user enters a non-existent video identifier, an appropriate error message should be displayed without crashing the application.
* **User Feedback**: Error messages should be user-friendly and provide enough information for the user to understand the issue.

---

### 7. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for this Version)

* Persisting library changes (ratings, play counts) to a file so they are saved between sessions.
* Allowing users to add new videos to the library or delete existing ones through the UI.
* More advanced playlist management features (e.g., reordering items, saving/loading playlists).
* Actual video file playback.
* More comprehensive input validation (e.g., for rating values).
